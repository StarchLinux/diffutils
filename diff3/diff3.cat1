     The ddiiffff33 utility compares the contents of three different versions of a
     file, _f_i_l_e_1, _f_i_l_e_2 and _f_i_l_e_3, writing the result to the standard output.
     The options describe different methods of merging and purging the sepa‐
     rate versions into a new file.  ddiiffff33 is used by rcs(1) to merge specific
     versions or create new versions.

     The options are as follows:

     --33      Produces an output script suitable for ed(1) with changes spe‐
             cific only to _f_i_l_e_3.

     --aa      Treat all files as ASCII.

     --EE, --XX  Similar to --ee and --xx, respectively, but treat overlapping changes
             (i.e., changes that would be noted with ==== in the normal list‐
             ing) differently.  The overlapping lines from both files will be
             inserted by the edit script, bracketed by "<<<<<<" and ">>>>>>"
             lines.

     --ee      Produces output in a form suitable as an input script for the
             ed(1) utility.  The script may then be used to merge differences
             common between all three files and differences specific to _f_i_l_e_1
             and _f_i_l_e_3.  In other words, the --ee option ignores differences
             specific to _f_i_l_e_1 and _f_i_l_e_2, and those specific to _f_i_l_e_2 and
             _f_i_l_e_3.  It is useful for backing out changes specific to _f_i_l_e_2
             only.

     --xx      Produces an output script suitable for ed(1) with changes spe‐
             cific only to all three versions.

     The --EE option is used by RCS merge(1) to ensure that overlapping changes
     in the merged files are preserved and brought to someone's attention.

     For example, suppose lines 7-8 are changed in both _f_i_l_e_1 and _f_i_l_e_2.
     Applying the edit script generated by the command

           $ diff3 -E file1 file2 file3

     to _f_i_l_e_1 results in the file:

           lines 1-6
           of file1
           <<<<<<< file1
           lines 7-8
           of file1
           =======
           lines 7-8
           of file3
           >>>>>>> file3
           rest of file1

     The default output of ddiiffff33 makes notation of the differences between all
     files, and those differences specific to each pair of files.  The changes
     are described by the commands necessary for ed(1) to create the desired
     target from the different versions.  See diff(1) for a description of the
     commands.

     ====   The lines beneath this notation are ranges of lines which are dif‐
            ferent between all files.

     ====_n  The lines beneath this notation are ranges of lines which are
            exclusively different in file _n.

EENNVVIIRROONNMMEENNTT
     TMPDIR  If the environment variable TMPDIR exists, ddiiffff33 will use the
             directory specified by TMPDIR as the temporary directory.

     /tmp/d3a.XXXXXXXXXX     temporary file
     /tmp/d3b.XXXXXXXXXX     temporary file

HHIISSTTOORRYY
     A ddiiffff33 command appeared in Version 7 AT&T UNIX.

BBUUGGSS
     The --ee option cannot catch and change lines which have ‘.’ as the first
     and only character on the line.  The resulting script will fail on that
     line as ‘.’ is an ed(1) editing command.
