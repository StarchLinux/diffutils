     ssddiiffff displays two files side by side, with any differences between the
     two highlighted as follows: new lines are marked with ‘>’; deleted lines
     are marked with ‘<’; and changed lines are marked with ‘|’.

     ssddiiffff can also be used to interactively merge two files, prompting at
     each set of differences.  See the --oo option for an explanation.

     The options are:

     --ll      Only print the left column for identical lines.

     --oo _o_u_t_f_i_l_e
             Interactively merge _f_i_l_e_1 and _f_i_l_e_2 into _o_u_t_f_i_l_e.  In this mode,
             the user is prompted for each set of differences.  See EDITOR and
             VISUAL, below, for details of which editor, if any, is invoked.

             The commands are as follows:

             ll | 11   Choose left set of diffs.

             rr | 22   Choose right set of diffs.

             ss       Silent mode – identical lines are not printed.

             vv       Verbose mode – identical lines are printed.

             ee       Start editing an empty file, which will be merged into
                     _o_u_t_f_i_l_e upon exiting the editor.

             ee ll     Start editing file with left set of diffs.

             ee rr     Start editing file with right set of diffs.

             ee bb     Start editing file with both sets of diffs.

             qq       Quit ssddiiffff.

     --ss      Skip identical lines.

     --ww _w_i_d_t_h
             Print a maximum of _w_i_d_t_h characters on each line.  The default is
             130 characters.

     Options passed to diff(1) are:

     --aa      Treat _f_i_l_e_1 and _f_i_l_e_2 as text files.

     --bb      Ignore trailing blank spaces.

     --dd      Minimize diff size.

     --II _r_e_g_e_x_p
             Ignore line changes matching _r_e_g_e_x_p.  All lines in the change
             must match _r_e_g_e_x_p for the change to be ignored.

     --ii      Do a case-insensitive comparison.

     --tt      Expand tabs to spaces.

     --WW      Ignore all spaces (the --ww flag is passed to diff(1)).

EENNVVIIRROONNMMEENNTT
     EDITOR, VISUAL
             Specifies an editor to use with the --oo option.  If both EDITOR
             and VISUAL are set, VISUAL takes precedence.  If neither EDITOR
             nor VISUAL are set, the default is vi(1).

     TMPDIR  Specifies a directory for temporary files to be created.  The
             default is _/_t_m_p.

EEXXIITT SSTTAATTUUSS
     The ssddiiffff utility exits with one of the following values:

           0       No differences were found.
           1       Differences were found.
           >1      An error occurred.

AAUUTTHHOORRSS
     ssddiiffff was written from scratch for the public domain by Ray Lai
     ⟨ray@cyth.net⟩.

CCAAVVEEAATTSS
     Although undocumented, ssddiiffff supports most long options supported by GNU
     sdiff, though some require GNU diff.

     Tabs are treated as anywhere from one to eight characters wide, depending
     on the current column.  Terminals that treat tabs as eight characters
     wide will look best.

BBUUGGSS
     ssddiiffff may not work with binary data.
